# Course Components Implementation Guide

This guide walks you through implementing the improved course-related components in your application.

## Components Overview

1. **CourseCard** - A unified card component for both user and admin views 
2. **CourseCardSkeleton** - A loading placeholder for courses
3. **CourseList** - The main component for displaying course listings

## TypeScript Fixes

We've addressed all TypeScript errors by:
- Making all properties optional with proper type guards
- Adding default fallbacks for all calculations
- Adding additional field name alternatives for flexibility
- Using proper null checks throughout the code

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update the Types

Replace your existing `types/courses.ts` file with our improved version which:
- Adds proper optional typing for all fields
- Includes alternative field names for flexibility
- Adds full types for all component props

### 2. Install the Unified CourseCard Component

1. Replace your existing CourseCard component with the unified version
2. Add the CourseCardSkeleton component for loading states
3. Update your CSS with the improved styling

**Key benefits:**
- Dark/light theme support using next-themes
- Consistent styling across all instances
- Better responsiveness and animations
- Support for both user and admin views

### 3. Update the CourseList Component

Replace your existing CourseList component with our improved version which:
- Fixes all TypeScript errors
- Adds proper dark/light mode support
- Improves mobile responsiveness
- Enhances the filter UI

## Usage Examples

### Using CourseCard for User View

```tsx
// For regular users (catalog view)
<CourseCard course={course} />
```

### Using CourseCard for Admin View

```tsx
// For administrators (management view)
<CourseCard 
  course={course} 
  onEdit={handleEditCourse}
  onDelete={handleDeleteCourse}
  isManagementView={true}
/>
```

### Using CourseCardSkeleton for Loading States

```tsx
// When data is loading
{loading && (
  <CourseCardSkeleton />
)}
```

## Dark Mode Support

All components now use the useTheme hook from next-themes to detect and respond to theme changes.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

// Inside your component
const { theme } = useTheme();
const isDark = theme === 'dark';

// Then use the isDark variable to apply classes
<div className={`${styles.container} ${isDark ? styles.dark : ''}`}>
```

## Mobile Responsiveness

The components have been enhanced for better mobile display:
- Filter toggle for small screens
- Responsive grid layouts
- Adjusted padding and spacing for small devices
- Better touch interaction

## CSS Improvements

The new CSS includes:
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- Local dark mode classes instead of global selectors
- Better transitions and animations
- Improved element sizing for responsiveness

1. **Unified CourseCard**

   - Handles all edge cases with fallbacks

2. **Skeleton Loading**
   - Matches the exact layout of the real component
